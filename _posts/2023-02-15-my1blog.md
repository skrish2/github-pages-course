Some people think that life is always supposed to be roses and sunshines. They are constantly disappointed and looking to point the finger at everyone else. 
They are happy to tell anyone who will listen how incredibly harder life has been for them than anyone else. Stay away from these folks, they will drain you.
Peace out for now.
